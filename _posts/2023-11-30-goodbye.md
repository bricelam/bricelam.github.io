The word *goodbye* comes from a contraction of the phrase *God be with you*. I'm sad to announce today that I'm leaving the Entity Framework team and Microsoft. I've been on the team for over thirteen years. I love my job, I love the product, and I love the community. I intended to stay until the day management eventually disbanded us.

I wasn't looking for a job, but God works in mysterious ways. He lead me to an opportunity that warranted my consideration. No, it doesn't pay more, and it certainly isn't more prestigious. Ultimately, I felt I was needed there for a season, so I accepted. They were generous enough to let me stay through the .NET 8 release.

The good news is they use Entity Framework. I strive to be a valuable member of the .NET open source community, and I will continue to do so. I'm excited to be working alongside you in the trenches using the product that I've poured my blood, sweat, and tears into. I anticipate experiencing a lot of customer empathy in the near future, and seriously questioning some of my past design decisions.

My new employer is a small, non-tech company. I'll be working in the IT department on a team of about seven (plus or minus two). Like all good SQLite developers, we'll live according to [the Rule of St. Benedict](https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html).

Until we meet again, goodbye.
